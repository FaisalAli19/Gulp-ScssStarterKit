This is the Project Starter Kit.

This Starter Kit include:

- Gulp
- PostCss
- Babel
- Webpack

Run Gulp Watch to run the server.
Run gulp Icon to create SVG Sprite and convert the same to PNG.
Rung Gulp Build to create the docs folder for final deployment.

This Starter Kit is for my personal projects but you are free to use it.

Thanks.
